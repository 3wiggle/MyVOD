Server.DLL is a Socket Wrapper I adopted long ago and still use today for clean TCP/IP uses...
It was acquired from Here:

https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12286/Simple-Client-server-Interactions-using-C

Lack of NuGet packaging and class dependencies cause our intended application to bloat greatly...
Therefore, I have included the binary DLL
The dependency is upon Windows.Forms.Control for threading purposes... 
And as such is not suited for direct inclusion and compiling with our DeskTop Console app here.


Socket.cs   the source file... 
Socket.html the documentation file...
Socket.dll  the compiled assembly (forgot the .net version but herein we are targeting .Net Framework 4.6)
